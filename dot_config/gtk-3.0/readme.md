# gtk-3.0

gtk 3.0 settings.

* can be configured by editing [`settings.ini`](settings.ini)
* OR can be configured with my [`xcs`](../../.scripts/x/xcs) script (recommended)
* OR can be configured with `lxappearance`.

## Note
Settings in `~/.config/xsettingsd/xsettingsd.conf` (not in source
control) have precedence over [`settings.ini`](settings.ini)!
